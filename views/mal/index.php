  LLAnim.us is back after upgrading to a shiny new server. I've been hard at work rewriting the site to use the core of the <a href='https://animurecs.com'>Animurecs</a> framework that I've been developing; as a result, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">everything is dead</span>things are going to take awhile to bring back up.
</p>
  This is going to take a bit of time and a <em>lot</em> of mental fortitude; the code for the previous incarnation of llanim.us is nearly six years old at this point, and much of it is, well, unfit for human eyes. But it'll get done, and I'll be putting updates on this page as things get done!
